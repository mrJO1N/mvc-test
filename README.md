I was thinking of making a simple blog application in which users without authentication could post posts...
but now I have a blank for trying out different technologies!!!

this app is deploing with two hosting providers:

- railway: https://mvc-test-production.up.railway.app/
- render: https://mekl2.onrender.com/

stack backend:

- express
- pattern: mvc
- DB: PostgreSQL
- validation: Joi
- tests: jest, supertest

stack frontend:

- html, css, js
- ejs

todo:

- add:

- - jsdoc generator funcs doc
- - swagger generator api doc
- - redis for caching

for my next projects i plan:

- add 'CHANGELOG.md',
- frontend constructors for user frendly interface,
- tg bot with 'telegram-bot-api' as admin panel or another one interface
